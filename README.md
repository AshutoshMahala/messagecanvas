# Dashboard for Message Preview Project

This is a mini project that demonstrates a dashboard application using React, TypeScript, and a mock API using `axios` and `axios-mock-adapter`. The application features a canvas where message previews can be added, selected, updated, and deleted, with a sidebar for editing the details of each message.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. run ```npm install```
3. run ```npm start```


## Aditional Note
In case you want to add a message preview. There is a small button "Add Message" below the dashboard heading on the top-left of the canvas.
